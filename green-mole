Pollo en pipián verde (Chicken with green sauce)

***   Ingredients   ***

For chicken broth
- 1 or 1 ½ chicken breasts (depending on how much poultry you want)
- 4 cups (1 liter) of water
- 3 garlic cloves 
- ½ onion cut in big slices
- 5 sprigs of parsley
- a pinch of salt

For pipián (=sauce)
- 4 to 8 green chillies (depending on how hot you want it, I guess 4 correspond to mild)
- ¼ onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 3 lettuce leaves 
- 1 cup (approx 45 g) of chopped radish leaves 
- 1 cup of chopped cilantro
- 1 ½ cups (approx 185 g) of unsalted raw pumpkin seeds 
- 2 spoons of olive oil 
- ½ liter of the chicken broth
- a pinch of salt 


***   Preparation   ***

Chicken broth

In a big pot with a lid, boil the water together with the chicken, the garlic, the onion, the parsley and the salt for 20 minutes. Then, remove all the veggies, save the broth and shred the chicken. 

Pipián

Heat a frying pan and toast the pumpkin seeds during 3 minutes, stir constantly until they “jump”.  Then, blend them without adding liquid.

Remove the seeds from chillies and boil them for 5 minutes with just enough water to cover them. Afterwards, drain them and blend them together with the onion, the garlic, the lettuce, the cilantro and the radish leaves until it has a homogeneous consistency. 

In a “big” frying pan (that has a lid), fry the ground pumpkin seeds during 2 minutes, stir constantly. Add gradually the blended veggies and the chicken broth, continue stirring until the lumps have disappeared, then cover it with the lid. 

When it is boiling, uncover it, add the chicken and reduce the heat. Let it cook for 20-25  minutes. Don't forget to stir occasionally and add more chicken broth if it becomes too thick.
